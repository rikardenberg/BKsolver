Readme of BKsolver 
Copyright (C) 2004-2005 by Rikard Enberg <REnberg@lbl.gov>

To run the program, do the following:

1) cd bin
2) Edit Makefile to insert correct path to GSL and correct
   flags for your compiler etc.
3) make
4) cd ..
5) Edit the file `settings' to suit your needs.
6) ./bin/bk settings &

NOTE! (July 2018)
-----------------
There has been a change in the GSL interpolation routines since BKsolver 
was written 13 years ago, so at the moment the option for reading an 
initial condition from a file does not work. The settings file has been 
changed to option 3. I will try to sort this out at some point.
